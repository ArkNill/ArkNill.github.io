Use the guide to prepare good looking posts! The theme has a sidebar which uses 3d transitions. To change the contents of the sidebar, look inside **_includes** folder for ``sidebar.html`` file and edit it.


## CSS elements
Since the theme is based on bootstrap, you can use bootstrap classes. Take a look at [elements](/elements) page.

## Compressed files
All the static files are compressed to enhance the loading speed. Remove ``layout: compress`` from **default.html** to uncompress html. Remove 

{% highlight yml %}
sass:
  style: compressed
{% endhighlight %}
from *_config.yml* to uncompress css(scss) files.
